= Terraform EKS Cluster Operations

This repo gives a quick getting started guide for deploying your Amazon EKS
cluster using Hashicorp Terraform. It contains all the cluster logic in the
`./cluster` directory then you can use the same setup to deploy workloads as
shown in the `./kubernetes` directory.

== Installation

We first need to make sure we have all the necessary components installed. This
means installing:

* link:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/[AWS IAM
  Authenticator]
* link:https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html[Terraform]
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]

The rest of this `readme` will walk through installing these components on
macOS.

=== Install AWS IAM Authenticator

For authentication with an Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes you
must use Amazon Identity and Access Management. To do so you must use an open
source tool called the AWS IAM Authenticator, this was built in partnership with
Heptio. After EKS was launched it was then migrated to ownership via SIG-AWS.

To install this, you can either use the vendored and compiled versions from the
Github releases page or you can use `go` to install from source.

[source,shell]
----
go get -u github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator
----

Now that we have this installed we should make sure it is in our path, to check
this we can run `aws-iam-authenticator` this should return the help
documentation for the binary.

Once we have validated that it is installed we can move on to installing
`terraform`.

=== Install Terraform

To install `terraform` on macOS, the easiest way I have found is to use the
`homebrew` packaged version. 

[source,shell]
----
brew install terraform
----

This, like any `homebrew` package will install the `terraform` binaries into
`/usr/local/bin/` which should already be configured in your path.

With `terraform` installed we can then move on to installing the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

=== Install kubectl

To install `kubectl` the easiest way again is to use `homebrew` on macOS.

[source,shell]
----
brew install kubernetes-cli
----

After this has completed we should have access to `kuebctl`.

== Clone This Repo

Now that we have all the requirements in place we can clone or fork this repo to
get started.

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/christopherhein/terraform-eks.git
----

== Provisioning an EKS Cluster w/ Terraform

Before we can get started we need to make sure we have all the providers
configured and we are in the right directly.

[source,shell]
----
cd cluster/
----

Now we're in our `cluster` directory we can then run `init` to load all the
providers into the current session.

[source,shell]
----
terraform init
----

[.output]
....

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
....

Now that we have `terraform` initialized and ready for use we can run `plan`
which will show us what the config files will be creating. The output below has
been truncated for breviety.

[source,shell]
----
terraform apply
----

[.output]
....
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

data.http.workstation-external-ip: Refreshing state...
data.aws_region.current: Refreshing state...
data.aws_availability_zones.available: Refreshing state...
data.aws_ami.eks-worker: Refreshing state...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + aws_autoscaling_group.demo
    ...
  + aws_eks_cluster.demo
    ...
  + aws_iam_instance_profile.demo-node
    ...
  + aws_iam_role.demo-cluster
    ...
  + aws_iam_role.demo-node
    ...
  + aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.demo-cluster-AmazonEKSClusterPolicy
    ...
  + aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.demo-cluster-AmazonEKSServicePolicy
    ...
  + aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.demo-node-AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly
    ...
  + aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.demo-node-AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
    ...
  + aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.demo-node-AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
    ...
  + aws_internet_gateway.demo
    ...
  + aws_launch_configuration.demo
    ...
  + aws_route_table.demo
    ...
  + aws_route_table_association.demo[0]
    ...
  + aws_route_table_association.demo[1]
    ...
  + aws_security_group.demo-cluster
    ...
  + aws_security_group.demo-node
    ...
  + aws_security_group_rule.demo-cluster-ingress-node-https
    ...
  + aws_security_group_rule.demo-cluster-ingress-workstation-https
    ...
  + aws_security_group_rule.demo-node-ingress-cluster
    ...
  + aws_security_group_rule.demo-node-ingress-self
    ...
  + aws_subnet.demo[0]
    ...
  + aws_subnet.demo[1]
    ...
  + aws_vpc.demo
    ...


Plan: 24 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
....

With this output you can see all the resources that will be created on your
behalf using `terraform`. If all this looks okay, we can then provision the
cluster.

[source,shell]
----
terraform apply
----

This will then go an provision the Security Groups, the VPC, the Subnets, the
EKS cluster, and the worker nodes. It should take around 10 minutes to bring up
the full cluster.

Before we can use the cluster we need to output both the `kubeconfig` and the
`aws-auth` configmap which will allow our nodes to connect to the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
terraform output kubeconfig > kubeconfig
----

This will output the `kubeconfig` file to your local directory, make sure you
keep track of where this file lives, we'll need it for the deployment of
services.

Next we will use the same `output` subcommand to output the `aws-auth` configmap
which will give the worker nodes the ability to connect to the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
terraform output config-map-aws-auth > aws-auth.yaml
----

With this file and the `kubeconfig` file out you can then configure `kubectl` to
use the `kubeconfig` file and apply the `aws-auth` configmap.

== Connecting to your EKS Cluster

Now that we have all the files in-place we can then `export` out `kubeconfig`
path and try using `kubectl`.

[source,shell]
----
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig
----

Now we can check the connection to the Amazon EKS cluster but running `kubectl`.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get all
----

[.output]
....
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.100.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   10m
....

With this working we can then `apply` the `aws-auth` configmap.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-auth.yaml
----

[.output]
....
configmap/aws-auth created
....

Now if we go an list `nodes` we should see that we have a full cluster up and
running and ready to use!

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get nodes
----

== Deploy K8s Resources to EKS with Terraform

Now the we have the cluster in-place and ready to use we can then use
`terraform` to describe some of our resources, this is analgous to using
something like `ksonnet` or helm but with the benefit of having variables that
we could use from the infrastructure instead of just what we've defined.

Before we get started I have placed this configurations in a separat directory
`kubernetes/` let's `cd` into that directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd ../kubernetes/
----

Now that we are in this directory we need to again make sure we `init` to
install all the correct `terraform` providers.

[source,shell]
----
terraform init
----

[.output]
....
Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
....

With is done we can then run `plan` to see what will be applied to the cluster.
In the `main.tf` file we defined a couple Kubernetes resources that will get
deployed for demo purposes.

[source,shell]
----
terraform plan
----

[.output]
....
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

data.external.aws_iam_authenticator: Refreshing state...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + kubernetes_namespace.example
    ...
  + kubernetes_pod.nginx
    ...
  + kubernetes_service.nginx
    ...

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
....

After doing a quick review of the `plan` we can see this creates a namespace, a
pod, and a service. We can then apply this using `terraform`.

[source,shell]
----
terraform apply
----

This will take a coupe seconds and you can then list all resources in the
`demo-service` namespace again using `kubectl`.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get all --namespace demo-service
----

== Conclusion

As you can see by this demo you can do full cluster operations for your Amazon
EKS cluster using `terraform`. You have the ability to provision a highly
available Kubernetes cluster backed by Amazon EKS and then deploy any number of
Kubernetes resources into the cluster using `terraform` and the Kubernetes
provider.

If you'd like to customize this repo for your own needs you can take a deeper
dive into each file in the `cluster/` and `kubernetes/` directories which are
fully commented to explain what each part is doing.

Questions, comments, please file Github issues. :tada:
